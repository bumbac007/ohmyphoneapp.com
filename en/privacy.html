            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to OhMyPhone! ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service"). Our core principle is to collect the minimum information necessary to provide the Service.</p>
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>OhMyPhone! operates entirely on your device. We do not have servers, and we do not collect or store your personal data remotely. All processing happens locally on your phone.</p>
            <p>To provide its functionality, the app requires access to the following data types, which are processed only on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location Data (GPS):</strong> To determine if your device is moving at a speed corresponding to a moving car. This data is processed in real-time and is not stored or logged.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion & Fitness Data (Accelerometer):</strong> To determine the physical orientation of your device (e.g., if it is lying flat). This data is processed in real-time and is not stored.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery & Charging Status:</strong> To detect when the device is connected to or disconnected from a power source.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>The information collected is used exclusively to enable the core functionality of the app: to arm the system under specific conditions and trigger a critical alert if it determines your phone may be left behind in a car. We do not use this information for any other purpose, such as tracking, analytics, or advertising.</p>
            <h2>Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not store, log, transmit, or share any of your location, motion, or charging data with any third party. All data remains on your device.</p>
            <h2>Required Permissions</h2>
            <p>For the app to function correctly, you must grant the following permissions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location Access ("Always"):</strong> Necessary for the app to check your speed even when running in the background.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications & Critical Alerts:</strong> Necessary to deliver the audible alarm, even if your device is in silent or Do Not Disturb mode.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
