            <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the OhMyPhone! mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>The App is a utility designed to provide a critical audio alert to help prevent you from leaving your mobile device in a vehicle. The functionality depends on a specific set of conditions being met, including the device charging, being in a horizontal position, and moving at a certain speed. Proper function is also dependent on the user granting the necessary system permissions (Location, Notifications, Critical Alerts).</p>
            <h2>3. No Guarantees & Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
            <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind. While we strive for reliability, we do not guarantee that the App will function without errors or interruptions at all times. Factors outside of our control, such as operating system updates, device hardware, or changes in your vehicle's power supply, may affect its performance. You acknowledge that the App is a convenience tool and should not be solely relied upon to prevent the loss of your property.</p>
            <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, OhMyPhone! and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of property (including your mobile device), arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the App.</p>
            <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of its owners. The App is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the Czech Republic and foreign countries.</p>
            <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make changes, we will post the revised Terms within the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after the changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
            <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@ohmyphoneapp.com">info@ohmyphoneapp.com</a></p>
